# Data Structures

In this lesson you will learn about the basic data structures in R and how you can create, modify, access and combine them.

A very useful mantra while approaching the R language is concisely summarized in this quote by John Chambers

> To understand computations in R, two slogans are helpful:
  - Everything that exists is an object.
  - Everything that happens is a function call.

Every object in R is effectively a `vector`. The simplest way to think about a vector is to picture it as a container of boxes. Each box contains an object. The boxes are ordered sequentially, and can be labelled optionally.

_Type__

The type of a vector is the type of the elements it contains, which could be one of the six basic data types in R: `logical`, `integer`, `double`, `complex`, `character` and `raw`.
